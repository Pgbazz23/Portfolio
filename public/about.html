<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Prathmesh Gondhalekar — a curious learner, builder, and someone who loves turning small ideas into meaningful projects.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently studying at PCCOER, where I explore coding, UI/UX design, and the world of technology with an open and experimental
 mindset. I enjoy working on things that help me understand how systems work and how they can be made smoother, simpler, and more useful.

Learning drives me. Whether I'm creating UI prototypes, coding small apps, or trying out new tools, I focus on steady improvement rather 
than perfection. Every project teaches me something — and that's what keeps me going.
</p>
What I enjoy working on:<br>
UI/UX design and user-flow <br>
Python, C++, and small full-stack projects<br>
Cybersecurity awareness and digital safety<br>
Problem-solving, brainstorming, and simplifying things<br>
